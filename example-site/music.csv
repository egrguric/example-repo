A graphical overview of the polyrhythmic occurrences in piano, bass, and drums in a piano solo by Herbie Hancock demonstrates two main types of polyrhythm: metric displacement and regrouping of subdivisions and their usage. By examining neural processing of the different types of polyrhythmic structures, the following hypotheses are posed: (1) Neural processing of metric incongruences differ in lateralization and strength between musicians and non-musicians at the pre-attentive level; (2) Processing of metric incongruence is consistent with a predictive coding framework, i.e., lower level brain areas estimate predictions of their expected input based on contextual information from higher level areas; and (3) Neural processing of polyrhythms are co-localized with areas of language processing in musicians.","Aarhus University,Denmark;Royal Academy of Music,Aarhus/Aalborg","Aarhus,Denmark",English,English,"Vuust,Witek_2014_Rhythmic complexity and predictive coding_A novel approach to modeling rhythm and meter perception in music",Journal Article,"Vuust,Peter",male,"Aarhus University,Denmark;Royal Academy of Music,Aarhu/Aalborg","Aarhus University,Denmark;Royal Academy of Music,Aarhu/Aalborg","Witek,Maria A.G.",female,"Aarhus University,Denmark","Aarhus University,Denmark",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rhythmic Complexity and Predictive Coding: A Novel Approach to Modeling Rhythm and Meter Perception in Music,,,,Frontiers in Psychology,2014,2014,"Keywords: rhythm, meter, rhythmic complexity, predictive coding, pleasure",Funk & Jazz,Jazz,Rock,,"Musical rhythm, consisting of apparently abstract intervals of accented temporal events, has a remarkable capacity to move our minds and bodies. How does the cognitive system enable our experiences of rhythmically complex music? In this paper, we describe some common forms of rhythmic complexity in music and propose the theory of predictive coding (PC) as a framework for understanding how rhythm and rhythmic complexity are processed in the brain. We also consider why we feel so compelled by rhythmic tension in music. First, we consider theories of rhythm and meter perception, which provide hierarchical and computational approaches to modeling. Second, we present the theory of PC, which posits a hierarchical organization of brain responses reflecting fundamental, survival-related mechanisms associated with predicting future events. According to this theory, perception and learning is manifested through the brain’s Bayesian minimization of the error between the input to the brain and the brain’s prior expectations. Third, we develop a PC model of musical rhythm, in which rhythm perception is conceptualized as an interaction between what is heard (“rhythm”) and the brain’s anticipatory structuring of music (“meter”). Finally, we review empirical studies of the neural and behavioral effects of syncopation, polyrhythm and groove, and propose how these studies can be seen as special cases of the PC theory. We argue that musical rhythm exploits the brain’s general principles of prediction and propose that pleasure and desire for sensorimotor synchronization from musical rhythm may be a result of such mechanisms",Frontiers Media S.

In fact, we often use the term life-style to designate a particular mode and manner °f existence. To attach the word style to a given phenomenon or set of phe- nomena is to suggest that it possesses something that is distinctive and indi- vidual to such an extent that it may be isolated from other generically similar Phenomena. For example, in discussing footwear we can fairly easily separate the sneaker from the boot, the sandal, the thong, and several other types of shoes, on the basis of their distinctive qualities. In doing so we are consciously or unconsciously involved in one of the rudimentary procedures of style analysis.  As used in the arts, the term style refers to various levels, from the very general to the very particular. For instance, on a very general level one can ter to a Western style of music (as opposed to a non-Western style), or to Renaissance style (as-opposed to, say, a baroque style), or to an operatic style (as opposed to, say, a symphonic style). On a more particular level one can speak of a dixieland jazz style, as distinct from jazz style in general. On a still more particular level one can deal with the style of a given composer or even a specific composition...In this chapter we will deal specifically with the formation and develop- ment of Rock (n' Roll style, and also, more generally, with the formation of several other styles that have evolved in the course of Western music.

Hooker recasts a signature riff from a ternary to a binary beat subdivision, paving the way for the triple-to-duple shift that characterized mid-century American popular music. Further, the boogie's hypnotic feel is attributed to two psychoacoustic phenomena: stream segregation and temporal order misjudgment. Stream segregation occurs when the musical surface is divided by the listener into two or more auditory entities (streams), usually as a result of timbral and registral contrasts. In Hooker's case, these contrasts occur between the guitar groove's downbeats and upbeats, whose extreme proximity also blurs their temporal order.

While the music remains relevant, it is Coltrane's life and his music's  history  rather than the music itself that have received the greatest level of attention. Consequently, the music, the initial inspiration, is only infrequently treated with a level of analytical rigor that it merits.                 Few scholarly works consider Coltrane's Classic Quartet, and still fewer analyze two of the music's most important features: interaction and rhythm. Furthermore, most studies analyze Coltrane's solos apart from the interactive context within which they take shape. Alternatively, the dissertation focuses on the music of the Classic Quartet and analyzes the solos  and  accompaniments, as well as interactions between the two. Its principal aim is to examine the harmonic and rhythmic structures.                 In contrast to analytical models indebted to a view of form from the analysis of Classical Music and written out compositions (""works"") that privileges motivic connections and other symbols of unity, the dissertation argues that to be consistent both with the perspectives of those who create the music and with aesthetic principles of improvisation, a conception of form must account for the ""processual,""  in time , interactions between what is performed (the musical surface) and predetermined substructures, which are not necessarily articulated. Original transcriptions demonstrate how the members of the Quartet create a rhetoric of tension and release by implying rhythmic structures and harmonic progressions that correspond to or oppose conventional rhythmic and harmonic substructures. Transcriptions of pre-Coltrane jazz also reveal a historical precedent for this aesthetic framework. Additionally, the dissertation examines original transcriptions of the Quartet's drummer, Elvin Jones, in order to explore the complex layers of implied rhythmic structures.

With respect to the latter approach, it was suggested that the development of any artist's style reflects not only the ""vertical"" influences between successive artistic generations (e.g .. Louis Armstrong/Roy Eldridge/Dizzy Gillespie), but also the more often overlooked ""horizontal"" influences between musicians who play together on a regular basis (e.g., Elvin Jones/McCoy Tyner/John Coltrane). As a prelude to examining the mutual influence exerted on each other by Elvin Jones and John Coltrane, the evolution of jazz rhythmic concepts to 1960 was summarized. Some illustrations of the riff, as a rhythmic device characteristic of the swing period, were provided; and the development of an asymmetric, discontinuous mode of handling rhythm by those bebop artists who overthrew the ""four equal beats"" characteristic of swing was also discussed.

These unconventional grooves deform the conventional rhythmic structures of rock, such as backbeat and steady pulse, in such a way that a listener’s sense of metric organization is initially thwarted. Using transcriptions from math-rock artists such as Radiohead, The Mars Volta, and The Chariot, the author demonstrates a new analytical apparatus aimed at making sense of the ways listeners and performers process these changing pulse levels: the pivot pulse. The pivot pulse is defined as the slowest temporal level preserved in a given meter change. The author suggests that the preservation or disruption of the primary pulse level (that is, the temporal level at which a listener’s or performer’s primary kinesthetic involvement happens, such as dancing or foot-tapping) is of paramount importance. For example, a change from 4/4 to 3/4, which preserves the quarter-note pulse, will be less disruptive to a listener’s metric entrainment than a change from 4/4 to 7/8 or 7/8 to 15/16, both of which split the primary pulse in half. In order to formalize pivot-pulse methodology, the author presents an algebraic model based on the commutative operations greatest common denominator and lowest common multiple. Pivot-pulse methodology is also applied metaphorically to the kinesthetic interpretations of performers and listeners to better understand the complex movements incited by math-rock grooves.",University of Tennessee,"Knoxville,TN,United States",English,English,"Osborn_2011_Understanding through-composition in post-rock, math-metal, and other post-millenial rock genres",Journal Article,"Osborn,Brad",male,DePauw University,University of Kansas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Understanding Through-Composition in Post-Rock, Math-Metal, and Other Post-Millennial Rock Genres",,,,Music Theory Online,2011,2011," Theory, analysis, and composition -- Form and genre; Popular music -- General",Rock & Metal,Rock,Experimental,Math-metal,"Since the dawn of experimental rock's second coming in the new millennium, experimental artists have begun distancing themselves from Top-40 artists through formal structures that eschew recapitulatory verse/chorus conventions altogether. In order to understand the correlation between genre and form more thoroughly, this paper provides a taxonomic approach to through-composition in several post-millennial experimental rock genres including post-rock, math-metal, art rock, and neo-prog. Combining the presence or absence of two salient formal parameters (hierarchical grouping structure and thematic unification) generates four possible through-composed archetypes. Representative examples from the post-millennial rock corpus are provided for each archetype, and accompanying analyses identify the specific musical elements that engender such formal divisions. Included interviews suggest that this taxonomic model is congruent with the language musicians use to describe their own compositional strategies. Throughout the article, a case is made for the substantive link between specific types of through-composed forms and the genres in which those forms regularly appear, as well as for the difference between formal designs found in post-millennial experimental rock and those found in conventional rock music. ",Society for Music Theory,"Bloomington,IN,United States",English,English,Brothers_1994_Solo and cycle in African-American jazz,Journal Article,"Brothers,Thomas",male,Duke University,Duke University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Solo and Cycle in African-American Jazz,,,,Musical Quarterly,1994,1994," Armstrong, Louis -- performances -- improvisation; performers--jazz and blues -- Armstrong, L.; Young, Lester -- performances -- improvisation; performers--jazz and blues -- Young, L.; Hawkins, Coleman -- performances -- improvisation; performers--jazz and blues -- Hawkins, C.; Ghana -- Ewe peoples -- traditional music -- improvisation -- compared with jazz; jazz -- improvisation -- relation to West African music -- 1920-50; performers--trumpet -- Armstrong, L.; performers--saxophone -- Young, L.; performers--saxophone -- Hawkins, C.; sound recordings -- jazz -- solos -- 1920-50; black studies -- jazz -- improvisation -- 1920-50; Jazz and blues -- Genera",Funk & Jazz,Jazz,African,,"Suggests a way to analyze and interpret jazz solos recorded between 1920 and 1950, and argues that improvised solos by black Americans have much to do with musical syntax characteristic of West African music.

This paper focuses on the rhythms and formal structures encountered in three distinct sub-genres of EDM: Drum and Bass/Jungle, Trip-Hop, and Intelligent. Works by Diesel Boy, DJ Dara, DJ Shadow, Goldie, Plaid, and Squarepusher are considered throughout.   Rhythms are analyzed using Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff's writings on listener intuition, grouping structure, meter, and tactus, Gretchen Horlacher's writings on cycles and hierarchical structures, and John Roeder's writings on pulse streams. Also considered are ideas put forth in the writings of Harald Krebs and more recently, Mark Butler. The paper combines all of the above approaches in an attempt to analyze not only the metrically consonant structures that pervade most of EDM, but also the metrically dissonant structures such as those created through the use of displacement dissonance and the layering of out of phase strata.   The rhythmic structures of EDM expand outward to create large-scale form. Traditional forms such as Passacaglia and even Sonata form are sometimes evoked in this music. While the intentions of the composers on producing these forms is doubtful, analyzing the works as such gives us a unique perspective on what is happening in the music. Tracing the form produced throughout entire tracks of EDM shows us how these forms are still being adapted today.",Florida State University,"Tallahassee,FL,United States",English,English,Tomaszek_1999_F.

As one of the primary creators of the bebop and Afro-Cuban revolutions, he twice fundamentally changed the way jazz improvisation was done. Later he extended his revolutionary reach by transforming the aesthetic of big band jazz. Gillespie's saga is chronicled as he moved from the lowest rung on the American social and political ladder to the highest. Born in fiercely racist Cheraw, South Carolina, in 1917, Dizzy climbed out of rural poverty to a role among the Swing Era jazz elite before his 21st birthday. With bebop during the late 1930s and early 1940s, Dizzy and four colleagues-Charlie Parker, Kenny Clarke, Thelonious Monk, and Charlie Christian-radically expanded the rhythmic and harmonic foundations of jazz. Subsequently, Dizzy and Mario Bauzá recast the music during the late 1940s by enriching it with Afro-Cuban polyrhythms. The trumpeter and his colleagues endured a torrent of criticism before their innovations were accepted into the mainstream. These criticisms were undercut by Gillespie's noted warmth and comedic skills, becoming beloved worldwide and achieving a popularity that few modern jazz musicians have ever enjoyed.",HarperEntertainment,"New York City,NY,United States",English,English,"Maggin_2005_Cubop_Dizzy Gillespie, Chano Pozo, and the Afro-Cuban jazz revolution",Magazine Article,"Maggin,Donald L.",male,freelance/artist,freelance/artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cubop: Dizzy Gillespie, Chano Pozo, and the Afro-Cuban Jazz Revolution",,,,JazzTimes: America's Jazz Magazine,2005,2005,"Jazz;Ethnic Music: Central America/Caribbean;Cubop;Cultural Influences;Jazz Musicians;Afro-Cuban music;Structural Analysis;Touring Musicians;Tours;Live Performance;Performing Styles;1940s;Timelines;Historical Significance;Pozo, Luciano ""Chano"";Gillespie, Dizzy;Cuba;Machito;Bauzá, Mario",Funk & Jazz,Jazz,Afro-Cuban,,"Historical aspects of the Cubop or Afro-Cuban Jazz movement are discussed with an emphasis on the style's innovators and founders such as Mario Bauzá, Dizzy Gillespie, Francisco Grillo (Machito), and Chano Pozo.

That is how musicians often refer to Eli ""Lucky""  Thompson's playing. His phrasing is the opposite of what one might expect,  they say. His accents fall in the ""wrong"" places, on the ""wrong"" beats,  in the ""wrong"" order. As they speak, their tone mixes awe with irony. Irony,  that is, because his style seems to counter the hip way of phrasing they  worked so hard to cultivate. And awe, because he pulls it off.  Thompson, an eccentric even to admirers, a marginal figure in histories of  jazz, is a master of the tenor and soprano saxophones. (Though still alive at  this writing, Thompson has unfortunately not been active for almost 30 years.)  His career bridged the worlds of the canonical Charlie Parker and John  Coltrane, and he often stood at the cutting edge with both. Thompson's distinctive  rhythmic approach actually grew from and advanced a significant jazz  tradition. Bringing that context back in will help make sense of his ""backward""  style and show how forward looking it really was. Focusing in particular  on his deft use of phrasing tools such as accents, articulation, and timing  can yield some valuable insights on the role they play in jazz improvisation.","Scarecrow Press,Inc","New Brunswick,NJ,United States",English,English,Trikt_2007_Interview_Jymie Merritt,Magazine Article,"Trikt,Ludwig Van",male,freelance/artist,freelance/artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Interview: Jymie Merritt,,,,Cadence: The Review of Jazz & Blues - Creative Improvised Music,2007,2007,"Blues Music;Jazz;Bassists;Playing Techniques;Double Basses;Jazz Musicians;Careers;Music Education;Polyrhythm;Music Theory;Music Scene;Merritt, Jymie",Funk & Jazz,Jazz,,,"An interview with jazz bassist Merritt is presented.

At its core, jazz gains much of its vitality from the constant tension between strong and weak beats in any given passage. The backbone of jazz rhythm is syncopation-the placement of accented beats or rhythms in typically unaccented locations-and the interplay between multiple layers of both syncopated and unsyncopated rhythmic patterns. As a result, most jazz performances feature a variegated and complex rhythmic texture. While this rhythmic complexity is one of the most characteristic features of  jazz this aspect of jazz is often overlooked in jazz theory and analysis; most jazz theory tends to focus on pitch issues such as harmonic progression, voice leading, motivic development, and so on.   In our paper, we would like to examine this somewhat neglected parameter of jazz music by applying the ideas of metric consonance and dissonance, concepts first developed by music theorist Harald Krebs in his discussion of 19thcentury  music in general, and the music of Robert Schumann in particular. Time and space constraints prohibit us from taking an exhaustive look at the jazz literature from this analytical perspective, so we will focus our attention on selected musical examples of two well-known and, in their own ways, innovative jazz pianists: Thelonious Monk and James P. Johnson. That Monk's career post-dates Johnson's by some 20 years allows us to observe how Monk's approach to the instrument differs from and is similar to Johnson's, and to observe the implications that these similarities and differences  have on the overall metric consonance and dissonance of their respective music. We will conclude with an example by a young Mary Lou Williams that reveals the strong influence of Johnson on her playing style in general and on her approach to rhythm in particular.

Recorded during Hancock's tenures with Donald Byrd and Miles Davis, his early works are highly mature musical conceptions, with all the major elements of Hancock's personal musical style already present.                 A mixed-methods approach combining several forms of qualitative data analyses is used to identify the formal construction, the musical meanings, and the cultural significance of this body of music. The study surveys the thirty-six compositions that comprise these seven albums, and selects for in-depth analysis seven pieces that are proportionally representative of the formal characteristics of this larger repertoire: ""The Maze,"" ""The Pleasure Is Mine,"" ""Jack Rabbit,"" ""One Finger Snap,"" ""Little One,"" ""Toys,"" and ""I Have A Dream.""                 Hancock's improvisations on these representative compositions are transcribed, and each improvisation and composition is analyzed for its historical, aesthetic, and formal properties. The cultural and historical context and significance of each recording is examined through interviews with persons involved in the original recording process, as well as other jazz musicians and scholars with deep knowledge of Hancock's life, music and oeuvre. Aesthetic analyses, informed by the theories of Kivy and Elliott, investigate the expressive or representational qualities of each composition, and examine how formal musical elements contribute to these expressive or representational qualities. Formal analyses examine elements of harmony, rhythm, and melody characteristic of Hancock's compositional and improvisational style.                 The study concludes that Hancock's compositions and improvisations of this period exhibit a number of consistent style elements, such as sophisticated harmonic and rhythmic superimposition, that were an important influence on jazz pianists of the following generation.

This study analyzes the musical attributes of rap delivery. A theory is proposed that rhyme functions like motivic parallelism to embed a separate ""higher-level"" perceptual stream in the monophonic delivery. Thus rappers use rhyme and other prosodic features to create a multileveled rhythmic structure, akin to the 'implied polyphony' found in some monophonic melodic works (Stacy Davis, 2006/2011). It is argued that rap flow is structured so as to create expectations on multiple levels, which are alternatively fulfilled or thwarted to create a balance of tension and release analogous to that described in traditional music theories of melody and harmony. An empirical study is conducted which tests the validity of the theory by measuring the predictability of rap delivery using techniques from information theory. The entropy of the metric placement of the ""higher"" stream of rhyming syllables is shown to be modulated by rappers in order to give flow a balance of predictability and surprise. A corpus analysis of popular rap works reveals that the overall entropy in popular rap has increased over the genre's history, from the relatively predictable rhymes of ""old-school"" rap into the more complex flows of the 1990s new-school. This increase in rhythmic entropy reinforces the previously established increase in the complexity and volume of rhyme over the same period (Hussein Hirjee & Daniel Brown, 2010).",Ohio State University,"Columbus,OH,United States",English,English,"Condit-Schultz,Arthur_2014_Beat and switch_Multi-stable rhythms, metric ambiguity, and rock & roll fake-outs",Abstract,"Condit-Schultz,Nathaniel",male,Ohio State University,Ohio State University,"Arthur,Claire",female,Ohio State University,Ohio State University,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Doll,Christopher","Beat and Switch: Multi-Stable Rhythms, Metric Ambiguity, and Rock & Roll Fake-Outs",Rocky Relationships (SMT),AMS/SMT Milwaukee 2014,,,2014,2014,,Rock & Metal,Rock,,,"The question of how listeners infer a metric hierarchy from a musical surface hasattracted much attention.

Results indicate that the tendency to infer thefirst heard note as a down beat is extremely powerful.In a related study, newly composed rhythm excerpts were designed to test the influenceof the effect of metric interpretation on the qualia or ""feel"" of a rhythm.

It begins by defining such “pulse-neutral”(PN) rhythms as patterns that split their allegiance between a prevailing meter and a displacedversion thereof. To fit this definition within the context of existing theories of rhythm andmeter, this study uses beat-class theory to demonstrate how such rhythms can be formed bytransposition (time-shifting), by inversion, through the combination of metrically dissonantand consonant pulses, or by a generating interval. It then shows how PN rhythms arise infunk music, a genre that only very recently has begun to receive significant music-analyticattention. Included in this study is analysis of brief passages of funk music by artists such asParliament, Rufus, and James Brown, as well as excerpts of “linear funk,” an essentially monophonicstyle of drumming pioneered by players such as Mike Clark (Herbie Hancock), DavidGaribaldi (Tower of Power), and Steve Gadd (Paul Simon, Chick Corea).

Percussion ensembles are also growing in numbers and more literature for both types of groups has become available in recent years. New demands are placed upon the performer as well as the listener when interpreting music which no longer fits categorically into the classical or jazz style or into one traditional cultural context. Jazz composers and performers have long been influenced by African and Latin American rhythms. Composers of ""new music"" have cited a variety of influences including American jazz, European, black blues, gospel and most recently the east. An examination of available literature reveals relatively few ensemble works involving Afro-Jazz or Latin styles. Those that do are mainly short novelty pieces. Music educators have stated the importance of including contemporary music, jazz and improvisation in performance curriculums.                 Therefore, there is a need for an original composition which reflects the diversity of influences in the contemporary style. Schools need literature, to fill a gap in the repertoire, which does not demand exotic instruments or synthesized sounds and which is not too technically advanced or unique to be included in school programs. The Concerto for Percussion and Jazz Band was composed to help fill this need. A related paper includes a stylistic interpretive analysis as well as suggestions for teaching/rehearsing and performance.

Following initial commentary in Chapter 1 on the problems of categorization in the repertoire, Chapter 2 offers a preliminary discussion of  style  and form   in Zappa's music. Regarding style, I detail the fallouts of Zappa's unique early musical education as well as the influence of his guitar playing in his compositional style. My investigation of form explores the formal implications of melodic repetition, examining non-repeating forms characteristic of the  hybrid  music and repeating forms utilizing variation procedures such as contour retention  and  isomelism .                 Chapter 3 is devoted to rhythm and meter in Zappa's music. The primary topics of this chapter are various types of rhythmic/metrical conflict, including polymeter, metrical dissonance , and rhythmic dissonance , which are explained in part as an attempted merging of advanced compositional techniques and rock/pop music norms. A theoretical discussion of rhythmic dissonance, which is Zappa's trademark rhythmic device, comprises the bulk of the chapter.                 Chapter 4 offers a Lydian theory  for Zappa's diatonic music, loosely adapted from George Russell's seminal jazz theory  The Lydian Chromatic Concept  (1953). This theory views the Lydian scale as representing a tonic state in Zappa's music due to its special static attributes. It introduces the concept of a Lydian system , containing a limited group of diatonic modes related to a common Lydian scale. Within, I demonstrate how the pitch structures of non-Lydian modes are related abstractly to those of the Lydian tonic, and follow by considering  pedal substitutions  and progressions  within the Lydian system.                 Chapter 5 is devoted to Zappa's non-diatonic music. The first section of this chapter explores Zappa's methods of chromatic  pitch organization, including pitch-class diversity, chromatic saturation  , and symmetry .

His compositions often maintain form and make use of traditional chord symbols, but harmonic and rhythmic ""looseness"" adds a degree of complexity and discontinuity, which may in part account for Hill's relative obscurity.

The reasons for this are examined. Black Atlantic rhythm is founded on the idea of groove or feel, which forms a kinetic framework for reliable prediction of events and time pattern communication, its power cemented by repetition and engendered movement. Overlaid on this are characteristic devices that include syncopation, overlay, displacement, off-beat phrasing, polyrhythm/polymeter, hocketing, heterophony, swing, speech-based rhythms, and call-and-response. Using an evolutionary argument, it is noted that nearly all of these have at their heart the establishment of perceptual multiplicity or rivalry, affecting expectation, which acts as either a message or a message enhancement technique (via increased engagement and focusing of attention), or both. The causal path for the remaining devices is based on adopting structures shared with speech, notably prosody, conversational interaction, and narrative. Several examples illustrate how, particularly in jazz and jazz-related forms, extensions and relatively complex creative adaptations of traditional African and African diasporic rhythmic techniques are a natural consequence of a culture of questioning and reflection that encompasses maintenance of historical reference and accommodation to innovation.",University of California Press,"Oakland,CA,United States",English,English,Norris_2007_Latin jazz as reflected through the performance practices of Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band,Dissertation/Thesis,"Norris,Alexander Pope",male,University of Miami,freelance/artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sidener,Whit",Latin Jazz as Reflected through the Performance Practices of Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band,,,,,2007,2007,"Communication and the arts;Education;Latin jazz;Performance;Fort Apache Band;Gonzalez, Jerry;Thelonious Monk;Monk, Thelonious;Andy Gonzalez;Gonzalez, Andy;Music;Music education;0413:Music;0522:Music education",Funk & Jazz,Jazz,Latin,,"The music and history of Jerry González's Fort Apache Band, as it pertains to the broad spectrum of Latin jazz, is the purpose of this study.

The improvisations were analyzed in three basic categories: (1) melodic contribution, (2) harmonic contribution, and (3) rhythmic contribution. There are numerous books of transcribed solos from all different instruments, however, few of these contain in-depth analyses of the music. Even fewer compare related artists over a span of time in the context of their musical contributions.

Many of those who study Coltrane's music have thus far attempted to approach all elements in his last works comparatively, using harmonic and melodic models as is customary regarding more conventional jazz structures. This approach is incomplete and misleading, given the music's conceptual underpinnings. The present study is meant to provide an analytical model with which listeners and scholars might come to terms with this music's more radical elements. I use Coltrane's own observations concerning his final music, Jonathan Kramer's temporal perception theory, and Evan Parker's perspectives on atomism and laminarity in mid 1960s British improvised music to analyze and contextualize the symbiotically related temporal disunity and resultant structural unity that typify Coltrane's 1965-67 works. I also filter all of this through my experience as a listener. My investigation treats, separately, Coltrane's solos of the period 1965-1967 as well as temporal and structural complexities in Coltrane's deployment and expansion of a jazz rhythm section; I then demonstrate, based on new historical research, the manifestation of similar but hitherto unexplored modes of expression in today's jazz and classical avant-garde as a way to begin to gauge Coltrane's long-term impact on improvised music that exists outside the 'jazz' canon. In Chapter 1, I present my bipartite analytical model of soloistic atomism and rhythm section laminarity, relating these to Kramer's concepts of multiply-directed linear and vertical time respectively. I then explore Coltrane's own words concerning his final music and regarding unity and disunity as he conceived them. Chapter 2 constitutes an examination of atomism in Coltrane's solos, in which I demonstrate that atomistic features increase in Coltrane's late works; this soloistic atomism is one component of my analytical model. Chapter 3 explores rhythm section laminarity, demonstrating the abandonment of tempo and pulse in favor of a more minimal aesthetic. Chapter 4 is devoted to a study of the way in which the innovative structural principles in Coltrane's final works are used by improvising composers Anthony Braxton and Paul Dunmall. As with Coltrane, both artists' compositions blur the boundaries between jazz and classical music, their work representing two transgenerational approaches to Coltrane's legacy.

The accent patterns help create hooks in three main ways: 1) one of the patterns is used to create a strong title hook, as in Rick Springfield's hit 'I've done everything for you', the title of which is set with a syncopated and distinct rhythmic pattern; 2) a hook in the form of a 'significant gesture' that usually precedes the chorus, as in the pre-chorus 'My-my-my-my-ah-woo' gesture from The Knack's 'My Sharona'; and 3) a hook involving the combination of a repeated accent pattern with a recurring pitch pattern, as in the guitar introduction to AC/DC's 'For those about to rock'.

This research dissertation comprised research and style analysis of selected Tito Puente timbale solos, in order to identify stylistic elements that could be traced to jazz or mambo conventions, to identify related stylistic trends over the course of Puente's career, and to identify paradigm figures or phrases of Puente's solo lexicon. The four solos selected for analysis were Mambo beat from his 1957 album Night Beat, Corta el Bonche from his 1965 album Carnaval en Harlem, Ran kan kan from his 1984 album El rey, and Cha cha cha mambo from his 1999 album Mambo birdland. The style analysis included observations of the solos and related contextual elements. Although some elements of the selected compositions were jazz-derived, Puente adhered strictly to mambo conventions in his timbale solos. He developed his solos based on a few key motivic cells, including the use of offbeats, hemiolas, and phrase-extending repetition and development. His phrases were constructed with a sense of tension and repose relative to the rhythm of the clave cells inherent in each phrase of each solo. The exception to these findings was Puente's composition Cha cha cha mambo, which was found to be a stylistic anomaly in formal construction and style as well as solo construction. Based upon the findings of this study, Puente's primary contribution to the genre of Latin jazz was his adaptation of standard jazz compositions into Afro-Caribbean styles.

This paper focuses on the interactions that shape the overall metric structure in a recorded performance of Ron Carter's Blues for DP. During this performance the musicians transition from an initially established 12/8 meter to new double-time meters. Numerous musical indicators suggest that these changes are negotiated in real time. By tracking these indicators I argue that the fluid metric shifting results from metrical dissonance. The interactive process will be highlighted through a reduction of transcribed musical selections to their fundamental rhythmic and metrical components. By highlighting only the metrical structures and by grounding the analysis in the metrical models as set forth by Harald Krebs and Christopher Hasty, the interactive process of ""suggesting,"" ""responding to,"" and ""settling on"" will be outlined. Krebs's grouping dissonance (Gx/y) and displacement dissonance (Dx+y) labels quantify the moments of metrical dissonance. Hasty's model, as set forth in Meter as Rhythm, accounts for the listener's perceptions of the resulting metrical dissonances. This paper concludes by outlining the following interactive tendencies that result from metrical dissonance. First, there is a tendency for the soloist to initiate the interactive suggestions. Second, there is a consistency in the type of metrical dissonance introduced-Krebs's G4/3 and G3/2-and to where the ""settling on"" occurs-in the â€˜turnaround' section of the form.

Embedded grouping dissonance is then situated in relation to EDM's technologically mediated means of production, arguing that this rhythmic technique exemplifies recurring principles of design that shape and reflect the aesthetics of electronic dance music on a broad scale.",Cambridge University Press,"Cambridge,United Kingdom;New York City,NY,United States",English,EnglishMerged version,Butler_2006_Conceptualizing rhythm and meter in electronic dance music;Electronic dance music and interpretative multiplicity;Ambiguity,"Chapter","Butler,Mark J.",male,University of Pennsylvania,Northwestern University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Conceptualizing Rhythm and Meter in Electronic Dance Music; Electronic d\Dance Music and Interpretative Multiplicity; Ambiguity,"Unlocking the Groove: Rhythm, Meter, and Musical Design in Electronic Dance Music",Profiles in Popular Music,,,2006,2006,"61: Theory, analysis, and composition -- Rhythm, meter, tempo;39: Popular music -- General;electronica -- rhythm and meter -- analysis;sociology -- electronic dance music -- relation to rhythm and meter;rhythm and meter -- electronic dance music -- analysis;form -- electronic dance music -- relation to rhythm and meter;texture -- electronic dance music -- relation to rhythm and meter;sound recordings -- electronic dance music -- relation to rhythm and meter;dance music--by genre -- electronic dance music -- relation to rhythm and meter",EDM,"Electronic Dance Music",,,"Rhythmic and metrical characteristics are at the forefront of musical experience in electronic dance music, a broad category of popular music encompassing styles such as techno, house, trance, and drum 'n' bass. The rhythmic and metrical organization of electronic dance music is explored from themicro-level to the complete DJ set, uncovering recurring principles of design that shape this repertory at multiple structural levels. The methodology employed integrates musical analysis, current theories of rhythm and meter, and ethnographic fieldwork. Nine complete tracks are analyzed and transcribed. Thevoices of DJs, producers, and fans provide important musical details as well as a broad sociocultural grounding. In both large- and small-scale organization, electronic dance music tends toward duple patterning, but within these constraints it creates metrical diversity through asymmetrical rhythms, displaced patterns, and conflicting rhythmic groupings. Rhythm and meter interact closely with texture:textural processes almost always have metrical ramifications, and independent textural layers frequently lead to metrical dissonance. Rhythmic and metrical experience in electronic dance music often involves ambiguity: the beginning point of a pattern may be unclear, and the absence of layers of motion may undermine the clarity of metrical perception. Formal organization is modular and open-ended. Three types of repeating entities-loops (short rhythm patterns), sequences (multi-measure instrumental combinations), and records-function as building blocks that can be combined and juxtaposed with great flexibility. While each constructive element governs a different level of musical structure, all are based upon cyclical repetition rather than linear progression. The modular design of electronic dance music both reflects and supports the interactive nature of its creation and reception. Dancers interact individually with the music and communally with each other and the DJ. The DJ uses fixed materials within a flexible performance that develops in response to a dancing audience. Though technology is central to this experience, it does not dominate it; rather, the creative and performative contexts of electronic dance music reveal an ongoing negotiation between humans and technology.

Since antiquity, writers on music have grappled with the nature of meter, and throughout the history of Western music their formulations have continually evolved, reflecting fundamental reevaluations not only of music but also of time itself. Drawing on paradigms from the history of science and the history of philosophy, this study investigates the connections between ideas on meter and time from the seventeenth century to the present day, and illustrates ways in which these two conceptions have mutually informed one another. It fills a conspicuous gap in studies of meter and of the history of music theory while bringing together diverse strands of thought in a genealogy of temporal conceptualizations. Four case studies form the body of the dissertation, each focusing on a particular moment in meter's history. Two analytical chapters supplement these case studies, incorporating current theories with historical perspectives on time and meter. In drawing the history of meter through to the twenty-first century, this dissertation offers a reflection on the claims made about temporality in our current theories, and a way of understanding meter and temporality as two pieces of a shared conceptual network.",University of Pennsylvania,"Philadelphia,PA,United States",English,English,"Squinobal_2009_West African music in the music of Art Blakey, Yusef Lateef, and Randy Weston",Dissertation/Thesis,"Squinobal,Jason John",male,University of Pittsburgh,University of Minnesota Morris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Davis,Nathan","West African Music in the Music of Art Blakey, Yusef Lateef, and Randy Weston",,,,,2009,2009,"Communication and the arts;Blakey, Art;Lateef, Yusef;Weston, Randy;West Africa;Music;0413:Music",Funk & Jazz,Jazz,African,,"This dissertation is a historical study of the cultural, social and musical influences that have led to the use of West African music in the compositions and performance of Art Blakey, Yusef Lateef, and Randy Weston. Many jazz musicians have utilized West African music in their musical compositions. Blakey, Lateef and Weston were not the first musicians to do so, however they were chosen for this dissertation because their experiences, influences, and music clearly illustrate the importance that West African culture has played in the lives of African American jazz musicians.                 Born during the Harlem Renaissance each of these musicians was influenced by the political views and concepts that predominated African American culture at that time. Imperative among those influences were the concept of pan-Africanism, the writings of Marcus Garvey and the music of Duke Ellington. Additionally, Thelonious Monk, Kenny Clarke and Dizzy Gillespie three of the most important contributors to the bebop revolution made great impressions on Blakey, Lateef, and Weston. All three musicians traveled to West Africa, and while each visited Africa for different reasons, all three were greatly influenced by the music they heard and the musicians they interacted with. All of these influences led to significant use of West African music in the works of Blakey, Lateef and Weston.                 Blakey, Weston, and Lateef became professional musicians in their own rights during a period of intense civil rights activities in the United States. Civil Rights activism along with the liberation of African Nations inspired compositions and performances by these three musicians that incorporated elements of West African music with jazz. Through these activities Blakey, Weston, and Lateef were able to provide artistic commentary on the strides being made for the civil rights of both Africans and African Americans.",University of Pittsburgh,"Pittsburgh,PA,United States",English,English,Ogren_1992_Debating with Beethoven_Understanding the fear of early jazz,"Chapter","Ogren,Kathy J.",female,University of Redlands,University of Redlands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Debating with Beethoven: Understanding the Fear of Early Jazz,America's Musical Pulse: Popular Music in Twentieth-Century Society,,,,1992,1992,38: Jazz and blues -- General;United States of America -- jazz -- early criticism;jazz -- reception -- 1920s;criticism--by subject -- jazz -- early criticism;mass media -- radio -- jazz -- influence on reception;ethics and morals -- USA -- jazz -- early criticism,Funk & Jazz,Jazz,Rock,,"Around 1920, when jazz first became popular, many African-Americans called it the devil's music and regarded it as inferior to sacred music.

My research reveals Willams' possession of autotelic personality and utilisation of learning techniques associated with heutagogy. Also identified is the prevalence of entrainment in the social and musical interactions of the New York jazz community and I interpret these qualities through the lens of the theory of complex adaptive systems as a model for learning in jazz drumset performance studies. I analyse Williams' ensemble and solo drumming in comparison to that of Blakey, Roach and Jones in addition to Roy Haynes by using an analytic schema designed specifically for identification of contrasting qualities in the voicing of rhythm and expression as revealed in the grouping and ordering of limbs in drumset performance.

The modern construction of the piano had yet to be fully standardized when percussive techniques were being applied to its keyboard. Since that time, pianists and drummers (especially those involved with the creation of groove-based music) have grown closer and closer, participating in what remains a richly symbiotic relationship. This study examines parallels between piano and drumming performance practices in jazz. In this context, drumming is acknowledged as an important inspiration guiding the expression of rhythm and percussive attack by non-drummers, pianists in particular.                 Historical connections between pianism and drumming in jazz are addressed through an examination of those legacies that are widely believed to derive from West African drumming, European march and dance traditions, and various aspects of the so-called ""Latin tinge"" from the Caribbean and South America. Playing techniques are compared in part based on the premise that similarities in musical output flow naturally from congruencies in instrumental architecture. Percussive action unites pianists and drummers, as do shared abilities to create rhythmic layers through the independent functioning of multiple limbs. A discussion of ensemble roles reveals conceptual links, especially with regard to time-keeping, ""comping,"" and mutual approaches to the creation of groove and swing.                 Transcriptions are employed to illustrate instances of widely adopted drumming-like gestures from the history of jazz with special attention paid to rhythmic counterpoint, complementation, and rudimental sticking patterns used by jazz pianists since the 1960's.

It seems very difficult-even impossible-to begin any activity with or about sounds without referring to categories such as 'kind', 'type', 'genre', 'style', or to metaphors like 'field', 'area', 'space'. Thinking about music, talking about music, making music: all these activities imply reference to a more or less detailed taxonomy, whose structure-not to mention its very existence-is too often taken for granted. Easy access to the world's diverse musical cultures (and so to even more 'types of music') has encouraged expanding and articulating existing taxonomies. However, some of the categories that we use date from more than 2000 years ago, and have been developed differently in different musical and/or national cultures. So, while categories like 'genre' or 'style' seem to be used mainly to 'put some order' and reduce the overall entropy in the musical universe (or, at least, in our talks and writings about music), sometimes they seem to create even more disorder and confusion. Some questions arise: 1) Why do we need musical categories? 2) How are such categories created? 3) Are historical categories like 'genre' or 'style' useful in all contexts? 4) What is the status of terms like 'field', 'area', 'space', 'boundary' and 'frontier'.",Ashgate,"Burlington,VT,United States",English,English,Brackett_2008_Examining rhythmic and metric practices in Led Zeppelin's musical style,Journal Article,"Brackett,John",male,University of Utah,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Examining Rhythmic and Metric Practices in Led Zeppelin's Musical Style,,,,Popular Music,2008,2008," rhythm and meter -- Led Zeppelin; performing groups--popular music -- Led Zeppelin -- rhythm and meter; sound recordings -- Led Zeppelin -- rhythm and meter; performing groups--popular music -- Fleetwood Mac -- sound recordings -- Oh well -- compared with Led Zeppelin Black dog; Brown, James -- sound recordings -- compared with Led Zeppelin The crunge; Theory, analysis, and composition -- Rhythm, meter, tempo; Popular music -- General",Rock & Metal,Rock,Funk,,"In this essay, I examine how aspects of rhythm and metre piay a fundamental role in shaping and defining Led Zeppelin's musical style.

Comparative analyses will be used in an effort to show how Led Zeppelin's flexible conception of rhythm and metre enabled the band to put their own stylistic 'stamp' on (i) specific musical genres ('The Crunge' and the song's relation to James Brown-style funk), (ii) their riff constructions ('Black Dog' in relation to Fleetwood Mac's 'Oh Well'), and (iii) their cover versions ('Dazed and Confused'). Drawing upon my analytical points, I revisit the complex issues that persist regarding the possibility that Led Zeppelin even has an 'original' or 'unique' style given their often overt reliance upon earlier musical models and forms.

This book traces the history of this music to its roots in French Impressionism and European Neo-Classicism, describes the key roles played by Bix Beiderbecke, Lester Young, Lennie Tristano, Claude Thornhill, and Dave Brubeck in the development of this genre, and focuses on the major figures associated with a group of landmark recordings and on an ensemble that felicitously came to be known as The Birth of the Cool. The contributions of Miles Davis, Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis, and John Carisi are considered in detail, and the scores of this music, arranged for Davis's nine-piece band, are analyzed and compared.",Pendragon Press,"Hillsdale,NY,United States",English,English,Parente_2011_Out of this world_ A collection of jazz-fusion compositions for quartet,Dissertation/Thesis,"Parente,Matteo A.",male,York University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Out of This World: A Collection of Jazz-Fusion Compositions for Quartet,,,,,2011,2011,Communication and the arts;Original composition;Music;0413:Music,Funk & Jazz,Jazz,Fusion,,"This thesis provides a historical and contextual basis for seven original jazz-fusion compositions. The thesis is divided into three sections. Section one examines the key musical elements such as melody, harmony, rhythm, form, and instrumentation found in jazz-fusion. Section two is a reflection of the historical development of jazz-fusion and how it has influenced my own work. Section three analyzes the melody, harmony, rhythm, and form of my compositions. The thesis concludes with a contextualization of these compositions in relation to contemporary jazz-fusion music. The appendix of this thesis includes complete scores of the compositions and is accompanied by a CD of recorded performances.",York University,"Toronto,ON,Canada",English,English,Shatford_2010_'When I Sat Down to Play the Piano'_ Compositions inspired by the poetry of Al Purdy,Dissertation/Thesis,"Shatford,Gerald Robert",male,York University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,When I Sat Down to Play the Piano': Compositions Inspired by the Poetry of Al Purdy,,,,,2010,2010,"Communication and the arts;Language, literature and linguistics;Canadian literature;Music;0413:Music;0352:Canadian literature",Funk & Jazz,Jazz,,,"The seven compositions for jazz piano trio that comprise the ""creative work"" portion of this thesis were written over a period of eighteen months and reflect my interest in a broad range of piano styles related to the jazz tradition, including boogie-woogie, stride, bebop, ""modal,"" and ""free."" The pieces can be performed individually, or as a concert suite, and are united by the source of their inspiration, that being the poetry of Al Purdy.                 Reading the selected poems out loud, I was able to generate simple rhythmic motives to which I later applied pitches, thus generating the basic melodic vocabulary from which each piece developed. If the compositions are programmatic, then they are so only in that decisions were made concerning the basic character of each piece based on the subject matter and flavour of each individual poem. At all times during the composition process I kept in mind that the resulting pieces would need to have utility for myself as a pianist, and that each piece should serve as a springboard for improvisation within the stylistic parameters established at the outset.                 Since this thesis involves the poetry of Al Purdy I begin with a chapter that draws attention to aspects of the poetry and the public persona of its creator that resonate strongly for a jazz musician. A second chapter offers my reflections on the diversity of composers drawing inspiration from works of literature (poetry in particular), demonstrating the variety of approaches undertaken by different artists, and emphasizing how the results ""embody"" their sources of inspiration to varying degrees. Finally, the seven compositions are profiled in individual chapters that outline their development. Four appendices supply supplementary information, and audio recordings of all the compositions are provided.",York University,"Toronto,ON,Canada",English,English,Shields_2011_Compositional concepts and process for small jazz ensemble,Dissertation/Thesis,"Shields,Robert",male,York University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compositional Concepts and Process for Small Jazz Ensemble,,,,,2011,2011,Communication and the arts;Music;0413:Music,Funk & Jazz,Jazz,,,"This thesis uses a framework of basic elements of music (rhythm, form, harmony, and melody) to illustrate a variety of concepts of interest to me in my composition. These concepts include polymeter, polyrhythm, upper structures, inversion of seventh chords in relationship to counterpoint, melodic phrase lengths and shapes, suspensions/delayed resolution, pointillism, and problems with notation. Application of these concepts in the compositional process, including intellectual and intuitive approaches and decision-making, will be illustrated. Influences of significance to my compositions, both musical and experiential, will also be discussed. The thesis is presented with a view that study is eternal: the expression of any idea in a composition is part of a learning cycle and will appear at a singular stage in my development. As such, directions for current and future work are indicated.",York University,"Toronto,ON,Canada",English,English
